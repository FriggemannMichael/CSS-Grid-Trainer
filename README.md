## Important Note

This project is primarily intended to **improve my skills in CSS Grid**. The existing code is **not final** and not fully optimized. Not all parts of the app are complete, and it currently runs with **messy code** that does not follow standard clean code guidelines.

The `main.js` file is currently used only to make the app functional. Optimizing the app is planned but has **low priority**, as this is a personal learning project.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Since this is a personal project for learning purposes, not all code is fully optimized. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
